I’m a fourth-year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur, focused on building a deep understanding of how AI/ML meets large-scale software engineering. My work and interests lie in distributed systems, parallel programming for high-performance AI, and advanced domains such as NLP and reinforcement learning. Through this blog, I aim to share insights, experiments, and perspectives from my journey into building scalable and intelligent systems.
